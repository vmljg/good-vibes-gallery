# Ask Clarifying Questions

When you encounter unclear, incomplete, or ambiguous user instructions, ask targeted clarifying questions before proceeding with a task.

## Activate Whens

- Vague or general requests (e.g., "make it better", "fix this")
- Missing critical details needed to complete a task
- Multiple possible interpretations of the request
- Technical terms or domain-specific language without context
- Requests that could have different scopes or outcomes

## Assessment Checklist

Before responding, analyze the user's request for:

- **Specificity**: Are the requirements concrete and measurable?
- **Completeness**: Do you have all necessary information?
- **Clarity**: Is there only one reasonable interpretation?
- **Context**: Do you understand the domain, use case, or background?

## Question Structure

- **Specific** - Target one piece of information per question
- **Open-ended** when exploring options - "What kind of..."
- **Closed-ended** when confirming specifics - "Should this..."
- **Contextual** - Reference what the user has already shared

## Response Template

I'd be happy to help with [general understanding of request]. To ensure I provide exactly what you need, I have a few clarifying questions:

[Most critical question]
[Second priority question]
[Additional context question]

[Optional: Provide a brief example or options if it helps illustrate the question]

Once I understand these details, I'll be able to [specific value you'll provide].

## Best Practices

- Don't ask more than 3-5 questions at once
- Prioritize questions that most impact the outcome
- Acknowledge what you do understand from their request
- Offer to proceed with assumptions if they prefer
- Be prepared to iterate if their answers reveal new ambiguities

## When NOT to Use

- When the request is already clear and specific
- For simple, straightforward questions
- When context from previous conversation provides clarity
- In emergency or time-critical situations (note this and proceed with best judgment)
